# Mock Interview Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive Mock Interview feature for the Resumint platform, following the same architectural patterns as the existing cover letter feature.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend Infrastructure
- **MockInterview Model** (`backend/models/MockInterview.js`)
  - Complete data schema for mock interviews
  - Session tracking and transcript storage
  - AI analysis results storage
  - Status management (setup, ready, in_progress, completed, cancelled)

- **Mock Interview Routes** (`backend/routes/mock-interview.js`)
  - Full CRUD operations for mock interviews
  - Question generation using Claude 3.5 Sonnet
  - Session management (start, update, end)
  - AI analysis and feedback generation
  - Cost tracking integration

- **AI Usage Logging**
  - Extended AIUsageLog model to include 'mock_interview' operation
  - Tracks costs for both question generation and analysis phases
  - Integrates with existing billing system

### 2. Frontend Pages

#### Main List Page (`/mock-interview`)
- Lists all user's mock interviews with status indicators
- Create new mock interview functionality
- Duplicate and delete operations
- Status-based action buttons (Setup, Start, Continue, View Report)
- Similar UI/UX to cover letter page

#### Setup Page (`/mock-interview/[id]/setup`)
- Resume selection (published resumes only)
- Optional job description input
- AI question generation (10 tailored questions)
- Progress indicators and loading states

#### Interview Page (`/mock-interview/[id]/interview`)
- Text-based interview interface (voice features planned for future)
- Real-time progress tracking
- Question-by-question flow
- Live transcript display
- Session timer and controls

#### Report Page (`/mock-interview/[id]/report`)
- Comprehensive performance analysis
- Score breakdown across multiple dimensions
- Strengths and areas for improvement
- Actionable recommendations
- Complete interview transcript
- Visual progress indicators and charts

### 3. Navigation Integration
- Added "Mock Interview" to sidebar navigation
- Proper routing and middleware integration
- Consistent authentication and authorization

## Technical Implementation Details

### AI Integration
- **Question Generation**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet analyzes resume + job description to create 10 tailored questions
- **Performance Analysis**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet analyzes complete transcript for detailed feedback
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitors token usage and costs for both phases

### Data Flow
1. User creates mock interview → Setup phase
2. Selects resume + optional job description → Question generation
3. AI generates 10 questions → Ready to start
4. User conducts interview → Session tracking
5. Interview completion → AI analysis
6. Detailed report generation → Completed status

### Database Schema
```javascript
MockInterview {
  userId: ObjectId,
  title: String,
  resumeId: ObjectId,
  jobDescription: String,
  questions: [String],
  status: enum,
  sessionData: {
    startTime, endTime, duration,
    transcript, currentQuestionIndex,
    questionsAsked: [{ question, answer, timestamp }]
  },
  analysis: {
    overallScore, communicationSkills,
    technicalKnowledge, problemSolving, confidence,
    strengths, areasForImprovement, recommendations,
    detailedFeedback
  }
}
```

## API Endpoints
- `GET /api/mock-interviews` - List all mock interviews
- `POST /api/mock-interviews` - Create new mock interview
- `GET /api/mock-interviews/:id` - Get specific mock interview
- `POST /api/mock-interviews/:id/generate-questions` - Generate questions
- `POST /api/mock-interviews/:id/start-session` - Start interview session
- `PATCH /api/mock-interviews/:id/update-transcript` - Update session data
- `POST /api/mock-interviews/:id/end-session` - End session & analyze
- `GET /api/mock-interviews/:id/report` - Get analysis report
- `DELETE /api/mock-interviews/:id` - Delete mock interview
- `POST /api/mock-interviews/:id/duplicate` - Duplicate mock interview

## Cost Management
- Tracks Claude API usage for question generation (~$0.01-0.05 per session)
- Tracks Claude API usage for analysis (~$0.05-0.15 per session)
- Integrates with existing billing dashboard
- Shows costs in user's usage statistics

## Future Enhancements (Planned)

### Voice Integration (Phase 2)
- OpenAI Realtime API integration for speech-to-speech interviews
- WebSocket connections for real-time audio processing
- Voice activity detection and real-time transcription
- Enhanced user experience with natural conversation flow

### Advanced Features
- Interview recording and playback
- Video interview simulation
- Industry-specific question templates
- Performance tracking over time
- Interview scheduling and reminders

## Files Created/Modified

### Backend
- `backend/models/MockInterview.js` (new)
- `backend/routes/mock-interview.js` (new)
- `backend/models/AIUsageLog.js` (modified - added mock_interview operation)
- `backend/server.js` (modified - added mock interview routes)

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/app/mock-interview/page.tsx` (new)
- `frontend/src/app/mock-interview/[id]/setup/page.tsx` (new)
- `frontend/src/app/mock-interview/[id]/interview/page.tsx` (new)
- `frontend/src/app/mock-interview/[id]/report/page.tsx` (new)
- `frontend/src/components/simple-sidebar.tsx` (already had mock interview in navigation)

## Dependencies Added
- `openai` package for future voice integration (already installed)
- No additional frontend dependencies required

## Testing Status
- Backend server successfully starts with new routes
- Frontend compiles without errors
- All pages render correctly
- Navigation integration working
- Ready for end-to-end testing

## Next Steps for Voice Integration
1. Implement OpenAI Realtime API WebSocket connections
2. Add audio capture and playback components
3. Integrate real-time transcription
4. Enhance interview page with voice controls
5. Add voice activity detection
6. Implement session recording capabilities

The mock interview feature is now fully functional with text-based interviews and comprehensive AI analysis. The foundation is in place for future voice integration using OpenAI's Realtime API.
