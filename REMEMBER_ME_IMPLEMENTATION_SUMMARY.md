# Remember Me Functionality Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the "remember me" functionality for the login system. Previously, the checkbox existed in the UI but was non-functional. Now it properly controls session duration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes

#### JWT Utility (`backend/utils/jwt.js`)
- Modified `generateTokens()` function to accept an optional `rememberMe` parameter
- When `rememberMe` is true: refresh token expires in 30 days
- When `rememberMe` is false: refresh token expires in 7 days (default)
- Access token always expires in 15 minutes regardless of remember me setting

#### Authentication Routes (`backend/routes/auth.js`)
- **Login Route**: 
  - Now extracts `rememberMe` from request body
  - Passes `rememberMe` to `generateTokens()`
  - Sets cookie `maxAge` based on remember me choice (30 days vs 7 days)
- **Signup Route**: 
  - Uses default token expiration (7 days) since signup doesn't have remember me option

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### Auth Context (`frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Updated `login` function signature to accept optional `rememberMe` parameter
- Updated `AuthContextType` interface to reflect new login function signature
- Login function now passes `rememberMe` to backend API call

#### Login Page (`frontend/src/app/login/page.tsx`)
- Updated form submission to pass `formData.rememberMe` to the login function
- No UI changes needed - checkbox was already functional in the frontend

## Token Expiration Behavior

### Without "Remember Me" (unchecked)
- Access Token: 15 minutes
- Refresh Token: 7 days
- Cookie expires: 7 days

### With "Remember Me" (checked)
- Access Token: 15 minutes (unchanged)
- Refresh Token: 30 days
- Cookie expires: 30 days

## Security Considerations
- Access tokens still expire in 15 minutes for security
- Only refresh token duration is extended with "remember me"
- Refresh tokens are stored as HTTP-only cookies for security
- Automatic token refresh system remains unchanged

## Testing
To test the functionality:
1. Login without checking "remember me" - session should last 7 days
2. Login with "remember me" checked - session should last 30 days
3. Verify that access tokens still expire every 15 minutes and refresh automatically

## Files Modified
- `backend/utils/jwt.js`
- `backend/routes/auth.js`
- `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- `frontend/src/app/login/page.tsx`

The "remember me" functionality is now fully operational and provides users with extended session duration when desired.

## Session Expiration Improvements

Additionally, improved the user experience when sessions expire:

### Before
- Users would see a blank white page when tokens expired
- No notification about session expiration
- Poor user experience

### After
- Users see a toast notification: "Your session has expired. Please log in again."
- Automatic redirect to login page after showing the toast
- Graceful handling of session expiration
- Toast notification lasts 5 seconds with a small delay before redirect

### Implementation Details
- Added `handleSessionExpired()` function in AuthContext
- Uses Sonner toast library for notifications
- Replaces direct `window.location.href` redirects
- Maintains protection for public portfolio pages (no redirect)
- Applied to both token refresh failures and max refresh attempts exceeded
