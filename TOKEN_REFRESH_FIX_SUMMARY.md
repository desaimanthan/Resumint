# Token Refresh Infinite Loop Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified
Your application was experiencing thousands of rapid-fire calls to `/api/auth/refresh-token` endpoint, causing an infinite loop that could overwhelm your server and degrade performance.

## Root Cause
The infinite loop was caused by a circular dependency in the `AuthContext.tsx` file:

1. `getCurrentUser()` called `apiCall('/auth/me')`
2. If that failed, it manually called `refreshToken()`
3. `refreshToken()` called `apiCall('/auth/refresh-token')`
4. `apiCall()` had its own token refresh logic that would call `refreshToken()` again on failure
5. This created an endless loop of refresh attempts

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Frontend Fixes (`frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)

**Added Safeguards:**
- **Refresh State Tracking**: Added `isRefreshing` state to prevent concurrent refresh attempts
- **Attempt Limiting**: Maximum of 3 refresh attempts with automatic reset on success
- **Cooldown Period**: 5-second cooldown between refresh attempts
- **Separate Internal Function**: Created `refreshTokenInternal()` that bypasses `apiCall()` to avoid loops
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better separation of concerns between token refresh and API calls

**Key Changes:**
- Removed manual token refresh from `getCurrentUser()`
- Added `skipTokenRefresh` parameter to `apiCall()` for refresh endpoint
- Implemented rate limiting and attempt counting
- Added proper cleanup and state management

### 2. Backend Enhancements (`backend/routes/auth.js`)

**Added Rate Limiting:**
- **General Auth Limiter**: 5 requests per 15 minutes for login/signup
- **Refresh Token Limiter**: 10 requests per minute for refresh endpoint
- **Progressive Delays**: 2-second delay after 8+ attempts from same IP

**Added Monitoring:**
- **Token Monitor**: Tracks refresh attempts by IP and User-Agent
- **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Alerts when >5 attempts from same source
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all refresh attempts
- **Admin Endpoint**: `/api/auth/token-monitor-stats` for monitoring (admin only)

### 3. Monitoring System (`backend/utils/token-monitor.js`)

**Features:**
- Real-time tracking of refresh attempts
- Automatic cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Activity analysis and reporting
- File-based logging for audit trails
- IP-based suspicious activity detection

## How to Monitor Going Forward

### 1. Check Server Logs
```bash
# Monitor refresh token activity
tail -f backend/logs/token-refresh.log

# Check for suspicious activity alerts in console
# Look for ðŸš¨ ALERT messages
```

### 2. Admin Monitoring Endpoint
```bash
# Get current stats (requires admin user)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:5001/api/auth/token-monitor-stats
```

### 3. Log Analysis
The monitoring system creates detailed logs in `backend/logs/token-refresh.log` with:
- Timestamp of each refresh attempt
- IP address and User-Agent
- Attempt counts per source
- Suspicious activity alerts

### 4. Rate Limiting Headers
The refresh endpoint now returns rate limiting headers:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests remaining in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: When the rate limit resets

## Prevention Measures Now in Place

1. **Multiple Layers of Protection:**
   - Frontend: State management and attempt limiting
   - Backend: Rate limiting and progressive delays
   - Monitoring: Real-time tracking and alerting

2. **Automatic Recovery:**
   - Failed refresh attempts don't cascade
   - Automatic cleanup of tracking data
   - Graceful degradation with user logout on max attempts

3. **Visibility:**
   - Comprehensive logging
   - Real-time monitoring
   - Admin dashboard for oversight

## Testing the Fix

1. **Normal Operation**: Token refresh should work seamlessly for legitimate users
2. **Rate Limiting**: Excessive requests should be blocked with appropriate error messages
3. **Monitoring**: Check logs to ensure tracking is working
4. **Recovery**: System should recover gracefully from any issues

## Emergency Response

If you see the infinite loop issue again:

1. **Immediate**: Check the monitoring logs for patterns
2. **Short-term**: The rate limiting should prevent server overload
3. **Long-term**: Use the admin monitoring endpoint to identify problematic IPs or patterns

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Fixed infinite loop logic
- `backend/routes/auth.js` - Added rate limiting and monitoring
- `backend/utils/token-monitor.js` - New monitoring system
- `TOKEN_REFRESH_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

The fix is comprehensive and should prevent the infinite loop issue while providing visibility into token refresh patterns for future monitoring.
