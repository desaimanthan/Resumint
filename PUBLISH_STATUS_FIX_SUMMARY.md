# Resume Publish Status Fix Summary

## Issue Description
When a portfolio was published, the resume still showed "draft" status and 67% progress instead of showing "Complete" status and 100% progress.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue had two main components:

1. **Backend Issue**: The publish route (`/resumes/:id/publish`) was only updating the `publication` object but not setting `isDraft: false` when a resume was published.

2. **Frontend Issue**: After publishing/unpublishing, the resume data wasn't being refreshed, so the UI continued to show the old status and progress.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes (`backend/routes/resume.js`)

1. **Publish Route Fix**:
   - Added `resume.isDraft = false;` when publishing a resume
   - This ensures that published resumes are no longer marked as drafts

2. **Unpublish Route Fix**:
   - Added `resume.isDraft = true;` when unpublishing a resume
   - This ensures that unpublished resumes are marked as drafts again

### Frontend Changes (`frontend/src/app/resume-builder/[id]/steps/publish/page.tsx`)

1. **Data Refresh After Publish**:
   - Added `await loadResume(id as string)` after successful publishing
   - This reloads the complete resume data with updated status and progress

2. **Data Refresh After Unpublish**:
   - Added `await loadResume(id as string)` after successful unpublishing
   - This reloads the complete resume data with updated status and progress

### Progress Calculation Logic

The frontend already had the correct logic in `ResumeContext.tsx`:
- Published resumes automatically show 100% completion
- The progress bar shows "Complete" for published resumes
- The calculation respects the `publication.isPublished` status

## How It Works Now

1. **When Publishing**:
   - Backend sets `isDraft: false` and `publication.isPublished: true`
   - Frontend reloads resume data after successful publish
   - Progress bar shows 100% and "Complete" status
   - Navigation shows green progress indicator

2. **When Unpublishing**:
   - Backend sets `isDraft: true` and `publication.isPublished: false`
   - Frontend reloads resume data after successful unpublish
   - Progress bar returns to calculated percentage based on content
   - Navigation shows appropriate progress indicator

## Testing Verification

To verify the fix:

1. Create a resume with some content (should show partial progress)
2. Publish the resume
3. Verify progress shows 100% and "Complete" status
4. Unpublish the resume
5. Verify progress returns to calculated percentage

## Files Modified

- `backend/routes/resume.js` - Added isDraft status updates
- `frontend/src/app/resume-builder/[id]/steps/publish/page.tsx` - Added data refresh after publish/unpublish operations

## Impact

- ✅ Published resumes now correctly show 100% completion
- ✅ Progress indicator accurately reflects publication status
- ✅ Draft status is properly maintained
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Consistent behavior across all resume states
